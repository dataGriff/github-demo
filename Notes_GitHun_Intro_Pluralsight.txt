Introduction to Git (Pluralsight)

Distributed - push it to other areas (if want to)
Branching - try it out in a branch and merge back into master branch...
Clean - one .git directory

You can create a .gitignore file 
This gets distributed too 

git works with content, not files

need to add files before commit
